    <h1>About Lion Life</h1>

    <p>
      The life of a lion is one of majesty and survival in the wild. These
      powerful creatures are apex predators, known for their strength, agility,
      and distinctive mane. Lions live in social groups called prides,
      consisting of related females, their offspring, and a few dominant males.
      The females work together to hunt prey such as antelope, zebras, and
      wildebeest, using teamwork and coordinated strategies to bring down large
      animals. The males protect the pride's territory from intruders and rival
      males, engaging in fierce battles to maintain dominance. Cubs are born
      defenseless and rely on their mothers for care and protection until they
      are old enough to join hunts and learn essential survival skills. Despite
      the challenges they face, lions exhibit remarkable resilience and
      adaptability, making them symbols of strength and courage in the animal
      kingdom.
